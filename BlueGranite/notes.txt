I just went through Todd’s hands-on lab for our workshops and took a few quick notes. Passing them along in case they’re useful.

1) Screenshots need to be updated in many places
2) Make sure you retain the VM “cortana” user and password as it's needed in many later exercises
3) Exercise 3 - Copy Data (PREVIEW) tool, Monitor and Manage, etc. in ADF - does not open in Chrome, so use IE on VM
4) Exercise 3 - "From the File format settings tab, leave everything as default except check the box Column name in the first data row"
               - Box is now checked by default
5) Exercise 3 - "Click on the hyperlink Click here to monitor copy pipeline."
               - This hyperlink only appears once everything has completed.
6) Exercise 5 - "In order to switch from running Scala code, to running SQL, your first line in the paragraph must start with %."
               - Should be the inline %%sql command for the context change
7) Exercise 5 - "Play icon" in Jupyter is "Run", "paragraph" is "cell"
8) Exercise 6 - "Type or copy/paste the URL of your Azure HDInsight Spark cluster, which can be found from the address bar when connected to the Azure HDInsight Spark cluster in previous Exercise 5."
               - Get Spark cluster URL early in lab 5 and retain for lab 6
9) Exercise 6 - PBI now has Import vs DQ option for Spark. Not specified in lab.
10) Exercise 7 - Web App requires Azure ML Workspace & Service ID
               - Obtain "ML Workspace ID" and "ML Service ID" from either Batch or Request/Response URI
               - do not enter full URI for Service as Todd's code takes care of building the URI
               - https://{0}.services.azureml.net/subscriptions/{1}/services/{2}/execute?api-version=2.0&details=true
               - {1} = Workspace
               - {2} = Service
