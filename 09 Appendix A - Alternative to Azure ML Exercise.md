# Appendix A: Alternative to Azure ML Exercise

Duration: 20 mins

Synopsis: The purpose of this exercise is the same as Exercise 1 above. However, it is included as an alternative in the case attendees fall behind or are otherwise unable to complete the exercise. The attendee will import a complete predictive experiment into a workspace that he or she already created. This exercise assumes the attendee has already completed the first task of Exercise 1.

## Task 1: Import the Completed Predictive Experiment Into Your Workspace

1. Go to [http://aka.ms/cortanaml](http://aka.ms/cortanaml). This will open a completed version of the ML predictive experiment in the Cortana Intelligence Gallery.
2. Click the **Open in Studio** button on the right side of the screen.
